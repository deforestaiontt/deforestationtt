                        <h4>3. OUR RELATIONSHIP</h4>
                        <p>We are offering You the ability and opportunity to donate towards the planting of one or more trees on the terms and conditions below:</p>
                        <ol>
                          <li>All payments You or someone else on Your behalf make to Us are donations to be applied by Us in accordance with Our Constitution and in particular towards the planting of ONE tree for each NZ$9 (or Other Advised Sum) You or any other relevant person donate (hereafter Your donation).</li>
                          <li>Each tree that is planted with Your donation will have a unique Barkcode TM that is applicable only to that tree and available only to You.</li>
                          <li>We will not cut down the tree Your donation has planted and will take all reasonable steps to ensure no other person can either, unless that tree is diseased, or we are required to do so by law, or a registered forestry consultant certifies it is necessary to do so for the health of the surrounding forest. If this occurs, paragraph (g) below applies.</li>
                          <li>You do own any tree or acquire any rights to ownership or possession of it that can be asserted against the owner of the land on which it is planted.</li>
                          <li>We will either own the land on which any tree is planted or will have a lease over that land for a term exceeding the expected life of the trees planted on the land.</li>
                          <li>You will not have any rights to any produce from the land on which any tree is planted, nor to any statutory rights which only arise because there is a tree growing on the land.</li>
                          <li>If Your tree dies or has to be removed before maturity, We will replant it and assign it the same Barkcode TM as that assigned to the deed tree at no extra cost to You.</li>
                          <li>You will not be charged any further sum for costs associated with Your Tree.</li>
                          <li>If for any reason we cannot plant Your Tree Our Constitution requires that surplus funds be donated to charitable purposes dedicated to fight climate change and You agree this will occur rather than any donation made by You being returned to You. We accept that different rules may apply to crowdfunding or “Kickstarter” donations that cannot be released to us.</li>
                          <li>While you have donated NZ$9 towards a tree being planted, You acknowledge and agree that in the future a different donation may be required to achieve this, which We refer to as Other Advised Sum, and this may be more or less than , depending on Our prevailing cost structure at any time;</li>
                          <li>When You make Your donation, We will make Our on-line Services available to You via Your Electronic Medium, but this is the sharing of Information and You and We agree that it is not provided as part of the NZ$9 donation You have made. If, however, the revenue laws of New Zealand require a consideration to be ascribed to this sharing of Information You and We agree that the consideration is NZ$0.50 from every NZ$9 (or Other Advised Sum) donated.</li>
                          <li>We will not require You to donate any further sums, other than NZ$9, towards finding the planting and maintenance of “Your Tree”. If costs in excess of that sum are incurred, We will meet them. Should part of the NZ$9 you donate not be immediately necessary for the maintenance of “Your Tree” or any associated costs, you will be able to verify in Our published accounts that any excess sums are carried forward.</li>
                          <li>The photos you see on Electronic Medium You are using to view “Your Tree” are Your tree once it is planted. However, photos provided of seedlings and nursery plants may not be of “Your Tree” because no Barkcode TM is assigned to “Your Tree” until it is planted.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <h4>4. THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS NOT MODIFIED</h4>
                        <p>Nothing contained in Our Services site or any Electronic Medium giving access to the same over-rides or amends these Terms and Conditions.

Any such referral shall be final and not subject to appeal except as allowed by law in New Zealand. Should either You or We elect not to refer any dispute to arbitration in accordance with this clause You or We waive the right to exercise any other remedies in relation to the dispute, except to the extent otherwise allowed by law.IN SOME JURISDICTIONS THIS MAY RESULT IN WAIVER OF A RIGHT TO JURY TRIAL AND YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOU MIGHT OTHERWISE HAVE THIS RIGHT.

                          <li>You and We agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the dispute between You and Us. To the fullest extent allowed by law (1) no arbitration shall be jointed with any other; (2) there is no right or authority for any dispute to be arbitrated on a class action basis or using class action procedures; (3) there is no right or authority for any dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons.</li>
                          <li>You hereby waive any right to a jury trial in any proceeding arising out of or related to this Agreement. </li>
                          <li>The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods does not apply to this Agreement.</li>
                          <li>You and We agree that the following disputes are not subject to the above provisions concerning negotiation and arbitration, namely (1) a dispute seeking to enforce or protect or concerning the validity of, any of Our intellectual property rights; (2) any dispute arising from allegations of theft, privacy, invasion of privacy or unauthorised use; (3) any claim for injunctive relief.</li>

                        <h4>17. ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF NZU POLICY; ESTIMATED SEQUESTRATION AND NATIVE TREE ALTERNATIVE SELECTION</h4>
                            <p>You acknowledge You have read, understood, and accept Our NZU policy which We set out as follows. First, no New Zealand Units or similar credits or grants (hereafter NZUs) received and owned by Us and which are measured by reference to land and/or forests owned in Our name, belong to You. Nor can such NZUs be the subject of any claim by You, whether to own or to receive compensation that is calculated by reference to such NZUs. Second, We are not required to make emission returns to any Government or Government agency or instrumentality at any shorter period than is required by law. Third, we do not and cannot guarantee how long and in what form future NZUs will be available. Fourth, We and not You have the sole right to keep or dispose of NZUs we own or can claim in Our name. You note and accept, however, Our preference is to keep such NZUs rather than encourage emissions by selling them as off-sets, and that it is prudent to retain such NZUs in case they are needed at some point to meet future costs of maintaining its forests. Fifth, we reserve the right, to be exercised at our entire discretion, to dispose of NZUs if it becomes necessary to do so to meet costs and liabilities that Your donation is at any time not budgeted to meet, including, but not limited to, maintenance costs; licencing/software costs; other contracted outgoings; and unknown costs which cannot be currently anticipated and are not provisioned for; save that no payments or disbursements will be paid other than as allowed under Our Constitution. Our Constitution provides that Our shareholders can take no benefits, and any contracts We will enter into after we provide Services to You must be on an arm’s length commercial basis; in all cases ensuring We remain not-for-profit.
                              You acknowledge and agree that estimates of sequestration are based on CO2 sequestration, not carbon stored, according to the formulae weight x 72.5 = dry weight, where 0.12bhD2 x (H x 1.2) = weight; bhD2 means diameter at breast heigh in inches squared and H means height in feet; and 50% dry weight x 3.67 = CO2 sequestered; and that estimates of D and H need to be empirically determined at maturity and cannot be other than estimates before then for which We cannot be in any way responsible should empirical determination prove them wrong or in using this formula. You further acknowledge and agree that We have estimated all CO2 usages by estimating the CO2 sequestered at 30 years of age for all tree species, and dividing that figure on a straight line basis, and that this is not intended to imply or promise that the resulting estimated usage, using this approach, equates to the actual sequestration that may have occurred, and which can only be determined by empirical measurement. You further acknowledge and agree that We have not promised to undertake such empirical measurement.
                              If We have offered to plant native trees with Your donation and You have accepted You acknowledge that the sum of $9 referred to elsewhere in these Terms and Conditions is to be read as the sum You are to pay for native trees.
                              You acknowledge and Agree that we reserve the right to plant the species of native tree with the donation you have made depending on the site conditions and suitability of the species to any environment.
                              </p>

                            <p>You acknowledge and agree the planting program which will maximise survival and growth rates of newly planted trees requires they be planted in the spring of any year, and consequently to be ready for planting in spring seedlings will normally be selected in spring, so they can enter the cycle in the nursery described in Our App and Website (“Cycle”) in spring also. Donations received in the period before any Cycle commences will be held in Our account, to be disbursed only against the costs associated with selecting Your seedling, growing it in the nursery, planting it and then growing and identifying it for You in the outdoors. Any administrative costs that are incurred by US in the interim will not in any circumstances exceed the amounts that are required to meet these ongoing costs.</p>
