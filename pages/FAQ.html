                                TreeTime is a non-profit organisation that empowers users to capture carbon, promote biodiversity and save the world in the process, starting from a $9NZD donation.<br><br>
                                Through the app, you will be able to plant real trees in New Zealand. Each donation will fund the planting of one tree. We call the tree you have funded ‘your tree’. Once you fund the planting of your tree through the app, TreeTime will source a seedling, grow it at one if its nursery partners, and plant the tree on land owned by TreeTime.<br><br>
                                You will receive a unique identifying code for your tree, or BarkCode™, that will show you on a GPS embedded map exactly where your tree is planted. You will also be able to monitor the seedling/nursery stage, as well as receive regular photo updates of your tree in order to track its growth. In addition to the above, the Carbon Dioxide (CO₂) feature of the app will update you daily as to how much CO₂ your tree we estimate has sequestered.

                                First, we require additionality. This means that without your contribution, the tree would not be planted.<br><br> 
                                Second, TreeTime is a non-profit organisation based on transparency. You will be able to view the status of donated trees through the app and follow their journey from a small seed all the way through to a large tree! Once trees are strong enough to be planted, TreeTime uses patented drone software to deliver photos of the exact tree via the unique BarkCode™ associated with that tree on your app.<br><br>
                                Third, using economies of scale we can plant your tree and maintain it for 50 years or more without any additional contributions starting from NZD$9 (as TreeTime takes no margin, the planting price may change subject to slight fluctuations in underlying costs).<br><br>
                                Fourth, New Zealand enjoys mild climate conditions, with severe weather events being a rarity. The temperature seldom rises above 30 degrees celsius/86 farenheit, and forest fires are extremely uncommon. Trees planted via the TreeTime app will have the best chance of survival as anywhere else in the world.<br><br>
                                Finally, our trees have been chosen in consultation with ecologists and foresters, and are professionally grown and maintained. You have the assurance that your contribution is assisting in both rapid carbon capture and promoting biodiversity.

                                TreeTime, like all non-profit organisations, does incur some administrative costs. We not only strive to keep these at a minimum but ensure that our annual accounts are published to show where your donation has gone. Any unused amounts are carried forward in the accounts to meet future costs associated with your tree.<br><br>
                                Your donation of NZD$9 does plant one tree and the BarkCode™ that is allocated to that tree is your assurance that the majority of your donation has been applied to the planting of the tree. To get your tree planted and growing involves: land cost, nursery costs, planting costs, and tree maintenance (such as weeding to ensure survival of the tree).

                                TreeTime differentiates itself based on transparency and user-friendliness. When you donate to fund a tree with us, you can see where your donation goes and that your tree meets requirements of longevity and additionality. TreeTime’s financials will be publicly available online.<br><br>
                                TreeTime is also passionate about providing a user-friendly interface, making tree-planting accessible and enabling everyday people like yourself who are concerned about the environment and its impact on their lives and that of their family to contribute towards mitigating climate change.<br><br>
                                We also aim for the TreeTime app to be educational by providing information on biodiversity and carbon, allowing you to view the amounts of carbon you have captured with reference to everyday activities, such as transport, eating and even getting into space!

                                TreeTime differentiates itself based on transparency and user-friendliness. When you donate to fund a tree with us, you can see where your donation goes and that your tree meets requirements of longevity and additionality. TreeTime’s financials will be publicly available online.<br><br>
                                TreeTime is also passionate about providing a user-friendly interface, making tree-planting accessible and enabling everyday people like yourself who are concerned about the environment and its impact on their lives and that of their family to contribute towards mitigating climate change.<br><br>
                                We also aim for the TreeTime app to be educational by providing information on biodiversity and carbon, allowing you to view the amounts of carbon you have captured with reference to everyday activities, such as transport, eating and even getting into space!

                                TreeTime is a non-profit organisation that empowers users to capture carbon, promote biodiversity and save the world in the process, starting from a $9NZD donation.<br><br>
                                Through the app, you will be able to plant real trees in New Zealand. Each donation will fund the planting of one tree. We call the tree you have funded ‘your tree’. Once you fund the planting of your tree through the app, TreeTime will source a seedling, grow it at one if its nursery partners, and plant the tree on land owned by TreeTime.<br><br>
                                You will receive a unique identifying code for your tree, or BarkCode™, that will show you on a GPS embedded map exactly where your tree is planted. You will also be able to monitor the seedling/nursery stage, as well as receive regular photo updates of your tree in order to track its growth. In addition to the above, the Carbon Dioxide (CO₂) feature of the app will update you daily as to how much CO₂ your tree we estimate has sequestered.

                                There are many.<br><br>
                                First, we require additionality. This means that without your contribution, the tree would not be planted.<br><br> 
                                Second, TreeTime is a non-profit organisation based on transparency. You will be able to view the status of donated trees through the app and follow their journey from a small seed all the way through to a large tree! Once trees are strong enough to be planted, TreeTime uses patented drone software to deliver photos of the exact tree via the unique BarkCode™ associated with that tree on your app.<br><br>
                                Third, using economies of scale we can plant your tree and maintain it for 50 years or more without any additional contributions starting from NZD$9 (as TreeTime takes no margin, the planting price may change subject to slight fluctuations in underlying costs).<br><br>
                                Fourth, New Zealand enjoys mild climate conditions, with severe weather events being a rarity. The temperature seldom rises above 30 degrees celsius/86 farenheit, and forest fires are extremely uncommon. Trees planted via the TreeTime app will have the best chance of survival as anywhere else in the world.<br><br>
                                Finally, our trees have been chosen in consultation with ecologists and foresters, and are professionally grown and maintained. You have the assurance that your contribution is assisting in both rapid carbon capture and promoting biodiversity.

                                TreeTime, like all non-profit organisations, does incur some administrative costs. We not only strive to keep these at a minimum but ensure that our annual accounts are published to show where your donation has gone. Any unused amounts are carried forward in the accounts to meet future costs associated with your tree.<br><br>
                                Your donation of NZD$9 does plant one tree and the BarkCode™ that is allocated to that tree is your assurance that the majority of your donation has been applied to the planting of the tree. To get your tree planted and growing involves: land cost, nursery costs, planting costs, and tree maintenance (such as weeding to ensure survival of the tree).
